## **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**
### **Arduino Live WiFi Web Pipelinecheckerboard**
In this project I am going to explain how a digital **Pipelinecheckerboard** was created  with _[LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B073QMYKDM/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=LEDs+arduino&qid=1607695120&sr=8-4)_(green, blue, red). The device uses a _[ESP8266 WiFi chip](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07DNNDC63/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2R1W5GGINQS1O&dchild=1&keywords=esp8266+wifi+modules&qid=1607695238&sprefix=esp8266%2Caps%2C374&sr=8-5)_ to connect to the Internet to get actual statuses and ids of different pipelines in a specific Githlab project, plus statuses such as on/off for the LEDs. The device is powered by a _[USB Data Sync Cable](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B01N9IP8LF/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=USB+Data+Sync+Cable+for+Arduino+UNO&qid=1607695408&sr=8-3)_ for Arduino UNO. Under the hood it uses an _[Arduino Uno R3](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6)_ compatible board, which are readily available, economical, and communicate well with the ESP8266 chips.
